        <h2>Malware</h2>
        <p>Malware, short for malicious software, is a blanket term for viruses, worms, trojans and other harmful
            computer programs hackers use to wreak destruction and gain access to sensitive information. As Microsoft
            puts it, "[malware] is a catch-all term to refer to any software designed to cause damage to a single
            computer, server, or computer network." In other words, software is identified as malware based on its
            intended use, rather than a particular technique or technology used to build it.

            This means that the question of, say, what the difference is between malware and a virus misses the point a
            bit: a virus is a type of malware, so all viruses are malware (but not every piece of malware is a virus).
        </p>
        <p><strong>Types of malware</strong></p>
        <p>There are a number of different ways of categorizing malware; the first is by how the malicious software
            spreads. You've probably heard the words virus, trojan, and worm used interchangeably, but as Symantec
            explains, they describe three subtly different ways malware can infect target computers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A worm is a standalone piece of malicious software that reproduces itself and spreads from computer to
                computer.</li>
            <li>A virus is a piece of computer code that inserts itself within the code of another standalone program,
                then forces that program to take malicious action and spread itself.
            </li>
            <li>A trojan is a program that cannot reproduce itself but masquerades as something the user wants and
                tricks them into activating it so it can do its damage and spread.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Malware can also be installed on a computer "manually" by the attackers themselves, either by gaining
            physical access to the computer or using privilege escalation to gain remote administrator access.

            Another way to categorize malware is by what it does once it has successfully infected its victim's
            computers. There are a wide range of potential attack techniques used by malware:</p>
        <p><strong>All of the following are considered plagiarism:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Spyware is defined by Webroot Cybersecurity as "malware used for the purpose of secretly gathering data
                on an unsuspecting user." In essence, it spies on your behavior as you use your computer, and on the
                data you send and receive, usually with the purpose of sending that information to a third party. A
                keylogger is a specific kind of spyware that records all the keystrokes a user makes—great for stealing
                passwords.</li>
            <li>A rootkit is, as described by TechTarget, "a program or, more often, a collection of software tools that
                gives a threat actor remote access to and control over a computer or other system." It gets its name
                because it's a kit of tools that (generally illicitly) gain root access (administrator-level control, in
                Unix terms) over the target system, and use that power to hide their presence.</li>
            <li>Adware is malware that forces your browser to redirect to web advertisements, which often themselves
                seek to download further, even more malicious software. As The New York Times notes, adware often
                piggybacks onto tempting "free" programs like games or browser extensions.</li>
            <li>Ransomware is a flavor of malware that encrypts your hard drive's files and demands a payment, usually
                in Bitcoin, in exchange for the decryption key. Several high-profile malware outbreaks of the last few
                years, such as Petya, are ransomware. Without the decryption key, it's mathematically impossible for
                victims to regain access to their files. So-called scareware is a sort of shadow version of ransomware;
                it claims to have taken control of your computer and demands a ransom, but actually is just using tricks
                like browser redirect loops to make it seem as if it's done more damage than it really has, and unlike
                ransomware can be relatively easily disabled.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>How to prevenet malware</strong></p>
        <p>With spam and phishing email being the primary vector by which malware infects computers, the best way to
            prevent malware is make sure your email systems are locked down tight—and your users know how to spot
            danger. We recommend a combination of carefully checking attached documents and restricting potentially
            dangerous user behavior—as well as just familiarizing your users with common phishing scams so that their
            common sense can kick in.</p>
        <p>When it comes to more technical preventative measures, there are a number of steps you can take, including
            keeping all your systems patched and updated, keeping an inventory of hardware so you know what you need to
            protect, and performing continuous vulnerability assessments on your infrastructure. When it comes to
            ransomware attacks in particular, one way to be prepared is to always make backups of your files, ensuring
            that you'll never need to pay a ransom to get them back if your hard drive is encrypted.</p>
        <p><strong>Malware Protection</strong></p>
        <p>Antivirus software is the most widely known product in the category of malware protection products; despite
            "virus" being in the name, most offerings take on all forms of malware. While high-end security pros dismiss
            it as obsolete, it's still the backbone of basic anti-malware defense. Today's best antivirus software is
            from vendors Kaspersky Lab, Symantec and Trend Micro, according to recent tests by AV-TEST.

        </p>
        <p>When it comes to more advanced corporate networks, endpoint security offerings provide defense in depth
            against malware. They provide not only the signature-based malware detection that you expect from antivirus,
            but anti-spyware, personal firewall, application control and other styles of host intrusion prevention.
            Gartner offers a list of its top picks in this space, which include products from Cylance, CrowdStrike, and
            Carbon Black.</p>
