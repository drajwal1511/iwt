        <h2>Security tools</h2>
        <p>Protecting our IT environment is very critical. Every organization needs to take cybersecurity very
            seriously. There are numbers of hacking attacks which affecting businesses of all sizes. Hackers, malware,
            viruses are some of the real security threats in the virtual world. It is essential that every company is
            aware of the dangerous security attacks and it is necessary to keep themselves secure. There are many
            different aspects of the cyber defence may need to be considered. Here are six essential tools and services
            that every organization needs to consider to ensure their cybersecurity is as strong as possible.</p>
        <p><strong>Firewalls</strong></p>
        <p>As we know, the firewall is the core of security tools, and it becomes one of the most important security
            tools. Its job is to prevent unauthorized access to or from a private network. It can be implemented as
            hardware, software, or a combination of both. The firewalls are used to prevent unauthorized internet users
            from accessing private networks connected to the Internet. All messages are entering or leaving the intranet
            pass through the firewall. The firewall examines each message and blocks those messages that do not meet the
            specified security criteria.</p>
        <p>The Firewall is very useful, but it has limitations also. A skilled hacker knew how to create data and
            programs that are believing like trusted firewalls. It means that we can pass the program through the
            firewall without any problems. Despite these limitations, firewalls are still very useful in the protection
            of less sophisticated malicious attacks on our system.</p>
        <p><strong>Antiirus Software</strong></p>
        <p>Antivirus software is a program which is designed to prevent, detect, and remove viruses and other malware
            attacks on the individual computer, networks, and IT systems. It also protects our computers and networks
            from the variety of threats and viruses such as Trojan horses, worms, keyloggers, browser hijackers,
            rootkits, spyware, botnets, adware, and ransomware. Most antivirus program comes with an auto-update feature
            and enabling the system to check for new viruses and threats regularly. It provides some additional services
            such as scanning emails to ensure that they are free from malicious attachments and web links.</p>
        <p><strong>PKI services</strong></p>
        <p>PKI stands for Public Key Infrastructure. This tool supports the distribution and identification of public
            encryption keys. It enables users and computer systems to securely exchange data over the internet and
            verify the identity of the other party. We can also exchange sensitive information without PKI, but in that
            case, there would be no assurance of the authentication of the other party.

            <br>People associate PKI with SSL or TLS. It is the technology which encrypts the server communication and
            is
            responsible for HTTPS and padlock that we can see in our browser address bar. PKI solve many numbers of
            cybersecurity problems and deserves a place in the organization security suite.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Penetration Testing</strong></p>
        <p>
            Penetration testing, or pen-test, is an important way to evaluate our business's security systems and
            security of an IT infrastructure by safely trying to exploit vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities exist in
            operating systems, services and application, improper configurations or risky end-user behavior. In
            Penetration testing, cybersecurity professionals will use the same techniques and processes utilized by
            criminal hackers to check for potential threats and areas of weakness.
            <br>
            A pen test attempts the kind of attack a business might face from criminal hackers such as password
            cracking, code injection, and phishing. It involves a simulated real-world attack on a network or
            application. This tests can be performed by using manual or automated technologies to systematically
            evaluate servers, web applications, network devices, endpoints, wireless networks, mobile devices and other
            potential points of vulnerabilities. Once the pen test has successfully taken place, the testers will
            present us with their findings threats and can help by recommending potential changes to our system.
